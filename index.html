        <h3>(objectively)</h3>
  <br>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Everywhere All at Once:</strong> In my opinion arguably the best movie of 2022 and I do not even think it is close. Gave me so many different feels.
            </li>

            <li>
            <strong>Bullet Train:</strong> Was worried that this one was going to end up just being meh but ended up being an extremely fun ride with good performances all around.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Nope:</strong> Loved Get Out, indifferent to Us, and would slot this right in between. I felt invested and entertained the entire way through and would consider it my favorite horror of the year despite not being too scary.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The Batman:</strong> I liked this despite thinking it had some big flaws but overall think this was the coolest the bat suit and car have looked in the live action movies and closest to the feel of a comic. Optimistic for any potential sequels.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Nightmare Alley:</strong> This was not in 2022 but thats when I watched so shhh. I can see this being considered slow but the whole story ties together so nicely and was compelling despite not being what I expected it to be.
            </li>
        </ul>
         <br>
          <h4><strong>Honarable mentions that weren't bad:</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Mad God, Fresh, Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, and The Bad Guys. 
        </p>

    <h2>The Bad</h2>
      <img src="./assets/images/Morbin-time" alt="Leto is Morbin">
      <h3>It was hard choosing only 5</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Morbius:</strong> This movie was crazy boring it was unbelievable. Why was there a little dance in the middle? One of many questions and the only good thing about this movie was a solid meme in "It's Morbin time"
            </li>
  
            <li>
             <strong>The Barbarian:</strong> This I had a ton of hype for based off the original trailer and a love for Bill Skarsgard so goes in bad for how disappointed I was. That and it got increasingly cheese and uninteresting.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Umma:</strong> I'm not even sure what to say about this without spoiling something but it was just all bad. <strong>ALL OF IT!</strong>
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Black Phone:</strong> Realising now it was a rough year for horror but this was one that had a concept that could have been interesting but just wasn't in any shape or form. Ethan Hawke was solid.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Dashcam:</strong> Yes, I am doing it again this is from 2021 but I saw it this year and damn this movie.  The main character is extremely hard to watch and unlikeable but that seems intentional so whatever but the concept felt good(with slight tweeks) and is completely wasted. Another just disappointment.
            </li>  
        </ul>
         <br>
            <h4><strong>Dishonorable mentions that were bad:</strong></h4>
            <p>
              Men, Death on the Nile, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Doctor Strange 2, and Thor Love and Thunder.
            </p>

      <h3>I watched these</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Scream:</strong> Now I think this movie was bad but it is scream so I end up just feeling neutral about it. Just feels on brand.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Choose or Die:</strong> Didn't feel really good or bad but I never turned it off and it kept my attention so another for the <em>"yeah, ok thats a movie"</em> pile.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>X:</strong> I did not love this movie but did like the homage to other classic horror movies and surprisingly made me hype for the planned trilogy this movie is attached to.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Orphan First Kill:</strong> To be clear I did not think this was good and almost included in list above if it was not for how amusing her changing heights the whole movie and the weird cuts to make her look small were. Got some good laughs despite it not being a funny movie and was almost out but about an hour in got sucked back in with more amusement. 
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Prey:</strong> Thought it was going to be really bad, it was not. This was a movie I watched.
            </li>
